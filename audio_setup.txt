Speaker Configuration Notes
Front L/R set to Small in Pioneer AVR
Crossover target: ~80 Hz
Subwoofer handles low bass for both movies and music
DALI Concept 1 provides improved midrange clarity, imaging, and musicality compared to compact satellites

Physical Connections

RTX 4090 HDMI Out -> Pioneer VSX-523 HDMI In (for 5.1 audio and video)
Pioneer VSX-523 Sub Pre-Out (RCA) -> Edifier T5 Input (optionally with RCA Y-splitter if sharing, but shaker sourced from PC)
Motherboard Green Jack (3.5mm Line Out) -> 3.5mm to Dual RCA Cable -> Amiya A1001 RCA Input
Amiya A1001 Speaker Outputs -> Speaker Wire -> Dayton BST-1 Shaker (observe polarity)
Arylic LP10 Output -> 3.5mm Cable -> Motherboard Blue Jack (Line In) for Chromecast streaming
USB DAC -> PC USB Port -> Headphones
Amiya Amp Power: 12V DC adapter (start low to avoid overpowering shaker)
Shaker Mounting: Planned for Herman Miller Aeron chair (non-destructive clamp/bracket to frame/seat pan, e.g., aluminum profile + L-bracket)

Software and Configurations

OS: Windows 11
Audio Drivers: Latest Realtek HD Audio from Gigabyte website
Primary Routing Software: Voicemeeter Banana (free, VB-Audio)
Hardware Outputs:
A1: USB Audio DAC (headphones)
A2: NVIDIA High Definition Audio (HDMI to Pioneer VSX-523)
A3: Realtek(R) Audio (green jack to Amiya amp/shaker)

Routing: Virtual Input lit to A1, A2, A3 (for simultaneous or switched output)
EQ on A3: Low-pass filter (boost 20-80Hz, cut above 150Hz) for bass-only to shaker
Latency: Buffer set to 192-256 samples (low-latency mode, tuned for sync)
System Settings: Prefer 8 Channels enabled for multi-channel support
Virtual Devices: Voicemeeter Input (stereo default for headphones), Voicemeeter AUX Input (5.1 for surround)

Realtek Audio Console: Installed for mobo jack assignments (green as line out, blue as line in)
Switching Software: SoundSwitch (profiles for toggling between Voicemeeter Input and AUX; one hotkey toggle)
Profile 1: "5.1 Daily" - Default to Voicemeeter AUX Input (5.1 surround)
Profile 2: "Headphones Gaming" - Default to Voicemeeter Input (stereo with Dolby Atmos)
Hotkey: Single toggle (e.g., Ctrl+Alt+1) for switching modes

Dolby Atmos for Headphones: Enabled on USB DAC (Settings > System > Sound > USB DAC > Spatial sound > On; upmixes stereo to virtual surround)
Media Players: Configure for 5.1 output (e.g., VLC: Tools > Preferences > Audio > Output > DirectX > 5.1; set to Auto or Dolby/DTS for content)
Other: No HDMI dummy plug in use (ineffective for audio persistence during monitor sleep)

Usage Notes

Daily (5.1): Pioneer handles surround + Edifier sub; shaker adds tactile bass via A3.
Headphones Mode: Stereo via USB DAC + Atmos + shaker bass.
Shaker Always On: Routed to A3 in both modes; adjust Amiya gain/low-pass for intensity.
Testing: Use YouTube bass/Dolby/DTS tests; ensure no distortion/clipping.
Troubleshooting: Restart Voicemeeter engine if routing fails; check Windows Sound settings for defaults.
