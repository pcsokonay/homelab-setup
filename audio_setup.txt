Physical Connections

RTX 4090 HDMI Out -> Pioneer VSX-523 HDMI In (for 5.1 audio and video)
Pioneer VSX-523 Sub Pre-Out (RCA) -> Edifier T5 Input (optionally with RCA Y-splitter if sharing, but shaker sourced from PC)
Motherboard Green Jack (3.5mm Line Out) -> 3.5mm to Dual RCA Cable -> Amiya A1001 RCA Input
Amiya A1001 Speaker Outputs -> Speaker Wire -> Dayton BST-1 Shaker (observe polarity)
Arylic LP10 Output -> 3.5mm Cable -> Motherboard Blue Jack (Line In) for Chromecast streaming
USB DAC -> PC USB Port -> Headphones
Amiya Amp Power: 12V DC adapter (start low to avoid overpowering shaker)
Shaker Mounting: Planned for Herman Miller Aeron chair (non-destructive clamp/bracket to frame/seat pan, e.g., aluminum profile + L-bracket)

Software and Configurations

OS: Windows 11
Audio Drivers: Latest Realtek HD Audio from Gigabyte website
Primary Routing Software: Voicemeeter Banana (free, VB-Audio)
Hardware Outputs:
A1: USB Audio DAC (headphones)
A2: NVIDIA High Definition Audio (HDMI to Pioneer VSX-523)
A3: Realtek(R) Audio (green jack to Amiya amp/shaker)

Routing: Virtual Input lit to A1, A2, A3 (for simultaneous or switched output)
EQ on A3: Low-pass filter (boost 20-80Hz, cut above 150Hz) for bass-only to shaker
Latency: Buffer set to 192-256 samples (low-latency mode, tuned for sync)
System Settings: Prefer 8 Channels enabled for multi-channel support
Virtual Devices: Voicemeeter Input (stereo default for headphones), Voicemeeter AUX Input (5.1 for surround)

Realtek Audio Console: Installed for mobo jack assignments (green as line out, blue as line in)
Switching Software: SoundSwitch (profiles for toggling between Voicemeeter Input and AUX; one hotkey toggle)
Profile 1: "5.1 Daily" - Default to Voicemeeter AUX Input (5.1 surround)
Profile 2: "Headphones Gaming" - Default to Voicemeeter Input (stereo with Dolby Atmos)
Hotkey: Single toggle (e.g., Ctrl+Alt+1) for switching modes

Dolby Atmos for Headphones: Enabled on USB DAC (Settings > System > Sound > USB DAC > Spatial sound > On; upmixes stereo to virtual surround)
Media Players: Configure for 5.1 output (e.g., VLC: Tools > Preferences > Audio > Output > DirectX > 5.1; set to Auto or Dolby/DTS for content)
Other: No HDMI dummy plug in use (ineffective for audio persistence during monitor sleep)

Usage Notes

Daily (5.1): Pioneer handles surround + Edifier sub; shaker adds tactile bass via A3.
Headphones Mode: Stereo via USB DAC + Atmos + shaker bass.
Shaker Always On: Routed to A3 in both modes; adjust Amiya gain/low-pass for intensity.
Testing: Use YouTube bass/Dolby/DTS tests; ensure no distortion/clipping.
Troubleshooting: Restart Voicemeeter engine if routing fails; check Windows Sound settings for defaults.

## Homelab Multi-Room Audio (Snapcast)  
Date: January 24, 2026  
Hardware:  
- 4x Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W (hostnames: snapclient1 to snapclient4, username: chocks)  
- 4x PCM5102A I2S DAC Decoder boards (purple PCB, required solder bridges: back pads FLT-L normal latency, DEMP-L off, XSMT-H unmute, FMT-L I2S; front pads tie SCK low for internal PLL)  
- chocksmainpc (Windows 11, default output: Voicemeeter AUX Input for 5.1 upmix via NVIDIA HDMI to Pioneer VSX-523)  
Configurations (per client):  
- Pi clients: /boot/firmware/config.txt: dtparam=i2s=on and dtoverlay=hifiberry-dac  
- /etc/asound.conf: Default to hw card 1 (PCM5102A)  
- Systemd service: snapclient.service with ExecStart using tcp://beelink.local:1704 -s plughw:1,0  
- Windows client (chocksmainpc): Launched via Task Scheduler at logon (batch file snapclient.bat: start /high snapclient.exe --host 192.168.0.9 --port 1704; run whether user logged on or not, highest privileges, hidden)  
Server (Beelink):  
- snapserver v0.34.0  
- Config (/etc/snapserver.conf):  
  - No persistent stream entries required for primary (Music Assistant uses dynamic TCP streams on 4953-5153)  
  - Fallback stream (optional, idle underrun beep mitigated): pipe:///tmp/snapfifo?name=MultiSpeaker&sampleformat=44100:16:2&mode=create&idle_threshold=3600000  
- Firewall (UFW): Allow from 192.168.0.2 to 4953:5153/tcp (MA dynamic streams)  
AirPlay Bridge (Beelink, fallback only):  
- shairport-sync (apt package)  
- Config (/etc/shairport-sync.conf): general name = "Homelab Multiroom"; output_backend = "pipe"; pipe name = "/tmp/snapfifo" (alsa section fully commented out)  
Control Apps:  
- Snapdroid (Android, official client for per-client volume/mute/latency adjustments; manual IPv4 connect preferred due to mDNS IPv6 priority)  
- Snapweb (browser fallback)  
Status:  
- Native Music Assistant Snapcast primary (group "Shed-Snapcast-Group" with 4 Pi clients + chocksmainpc; ~193ms latency offset on Windows client, superior sync/quality/consistency vs prior Chromecast line-in—Arylic LP10/Chromecast deprecated for main room multi-room)  
- AirPlay/MultiSpeaker fallback (~520ms latency offset; idle underrun beep disabled via high threshold)  
- Per-client latency adjustable in Snapweb (Clients tab) or Snapdroid for sync tuning  
- Music Source: Navidrome (Subsonic API) integrated into Music Assistant as primary local library provider (added Jan 2026)  
  - Base URL: http://192.168.0.9:4533  
  - Streams lossless/direct to Shed-Snapcast-Group via dynamic TCP  
  - Features: Full library browse/search/playback in MA, quick UI response  
  - Scan: Hourly auto (@every 1h) + on startup for new Lidarr imports  
  - Status: Tested and working perfectly (multi-room sync, no lag/cutouts observed Jan 2026)  

## Soulseek Integration (Rare/Obscure Music Automation)  
Date: January 28, 2026  
- slskd container deployed for Soulseek P2P network access  
- Shares: Read-only /mnt/media/Media/Music (~1281 files for upload credit/priority)  
- Downloads: /cache/soulseek/complete (future Lidarr import path) / incomplete  
- Active mode enabled (OPNsense port forward TCP 50300) → proven incoming uploads  
- Purpose: Fills gaps in Lidarr Wanted (old/rare/lossless not on torrents/Usenet)  
- Next: Potential Soularr bridge for automated searching/downloading/import to Lidarr  
- Status: Stable and active; manual searches/downloads tested
