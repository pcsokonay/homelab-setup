## Next Steps for Inventory
- Fill any remaining TBDs via smartctl -a for each (age from Power_On_Hours, health from Reallocated_Sector_Ct/Grown_Defects).
- Refine locations for any remaining unconfirmed drives if possible (e.g., during visual access).
- Update after 7 more drives are tested/added later this month; prepare for potential third vdev or new pool.
- Re-test new Green-P3 (YHKANHXG) post-long test completion; consider proactive replacement if defects grow or test fails.
- Run short/long SMART tests on new white-PX spares if desired before final storage; evaluate for third vdev if healthy.
- Review SMART test schedules and consider removing manual/automated ones to rely on built-in monitoring.

## Notes
* Previously unconfirmed locations now resolved for YXGSP3GK (Green-P4), YXGRDM8K (Blank-P1), YXGSP2TK (Blank-P3).
** High read/write errors (332/1100); I/O delays and ENXIO failures; mechanical clacking
*** 99 errors; grown defects 3
**** 16 errors
***** Failed long test at LBA 1345396536 (medium error); grown defects 7; corrected read errors 2997
