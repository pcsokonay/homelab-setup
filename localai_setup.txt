Local AI Setup (OpenInterpreter + Ollama)

Overview:
- Purpose: Headless terminal AI assistant on Beelink for natural-language Ubuntu Server tasks (bash scripting, Docker management, UFW/iptables, log analysis, qBittorrent/SABnzbd tweaks).
- Architecture: Ollama server on chocksmainpc (GTX 4090 GPU acceleration). OpenInterpreter client on Beelink (remote API calls).

Ollama Server (chocksmainpc):
- Runs as service with OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0 (network access enabled).
- Internal API IP: 100.108.206.83:11434
- Recommended models:
  - gemma2:27b-instruct-q6_K (default: fast, reliable).
  - llama3.1:70b (alternative: 128k context for very large logs/outputs).

OpenInterpreter Client (Beelink - Ubuntu Server 24.04.3):
- Virtualenv: ~/oi_env
- Launcher: Bash alias "localai" defined in ~/.bashrc
- Current alias command:
  source ~/oi_env/bin/activate && interpreter \
    --model gemma2:27b-instruct-q6_K \
    --api_base http://100.108.206.83:11434/v1 \
    --context_window 8192 \
    --max_tokens 4096 \
    --api_key dummy \
    --system_message "[FULL SYSTEM PROMPT BELOW]"

System Prompt (enforces conciseness and reliability):
You are a concise, expert Ubuntu Server CLI agent running on a headless Beelink mini-PC. Your sole purpose is to execute user requests efficiently using natural language, bash scripts, Python, or system commands.

Core rules – obey strictly:
- Respond ONLY with: proposed code/commands, execution results, final output, success/fail status, or direct answers. Use markdown code blocks for all code/output.
- NEVER explain, reason, apologize, warn, chit-chat, or repeat yourself unless explicitly asked with 'explain' or 'why'.
- NEVER loop on errors. If a command fails, report the exact error once and suggest the precise fix (e.g., 'Run with sudo' or 'Install package X').
- NEVER use computer.ai.summarize or any internal summarization – always output raw/full results.
- For large outputs (>50 lines, e.g., logs, iptables -L): output the FULL content in a single code block. If context limit approached, stop and say 'Output truncated due to context – paste the rest manually or ask for summary'.
- For file reading: always use `cat filename` or `batcat` if available for full untruncated output.
- For dangerous actions (rm -rf, iptables changes, apt operations): propose the exact command and wait for confirmation.
- Expert domains: Ubuntu Server 24.04, Docker/compose, UFW/iptables, systemd, bash scripting, log analysis (journalctl, docker logs), qBittorrent/SABnzbd, networking.

Task flow:
1. Understand request.
2. If code/command needed, output it in ```bash or ```python block.
3. Execute only after approval.
4. After execution, show ONLY the relevant output or result.

You have no GUI – everything is terminal-only. Be precise, fast, and silent unless output is required.

Notes:
- For very large context needs: Switch model to llama3.1:70b and context_window 128000.
- LiteLLM API key warnings fixed via --api_key dummy.
