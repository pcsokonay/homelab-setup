# Terminal AI Assistant Setup (Updated Feb 2026)

## Previous Attempts
- **OpenInterpreter**: Abandoned due to truncation, loops, hallucinations, and confirmation spam.
- **llm**: Reliable for pure generation with templates, but no tools/agent execution.
- **aichat/llm-functions**: Abandoned due to slow performance, context overflows/crashes, incomplete chaining/forgetting, tool errors/frustrations, and overall overkill for simple tasks (see summary below for details).
- **term_agent** - so very close to being usable that it was sad to give up on it. I havent actually removed it because I really like the idea, its just short of being useful.

## Current
- **Primary**: None - Switched to GitHub Copilot CLI for all sysadmin tasks.

## Notes
- All previous installs, configs, and aliases removed per user request.
- GitHub Copilot CLI installed via npm install -g @github/copilot; authenticate with GitHub account.
- Use for command syntax, explanations, and safe executions with approvals.
