# Home Server Roadmap - Generated 04/JAN/2026 12:00 AEDT

## Notes
- **Planned immediate next steps in order**:
  1. Dashboard
  2. tbd

- Use open-source, cost-effective solutions (Ubuntu, TrueNAS, OpenWRT, OPNsense).

## Explore *arr Apps
- **Purpose:**
  - Add media automation (music, eBooks, comics, transcoding, indexers).
- **Plan:**
  - Evaluate Lidarr (music).
  - Evaluate Readarr (eBooks).
  - Evaluate Mylar3 (comics).
  - Install via Docker.
  - Integrate with Prowlarr/qBittorrent/Jellyfin.
  - Add Jellyseerr for requests/discovery (pending evaluation).
  - Bazarr for subtitles (focus on forced subs for mixed-language content, e.g., non-English in English movies).
  - theme.park for UI themes (pending/low-priority).
- **Status:**
  - Pending more indexers/evaluation, plus Jellyseerr/theme.park.

## Integrate Snapcast
- **Purpose:**
  - Synchronous multiroom audio playback, extending Jellyfin for Sonos-like audio distribution.
- **Plan:**
  - Install Snapserver on home server.
  - Configure Jellyfin audio output to Snapserver's fifo (/tmp/snapfifo).
  - Set up Snapclients on devices.
  - Use codecs like FLAC/Opus for low-latency sync.
- **Status:**
  - Not started.
  - Requires server/client setup and Jellyfin integration.

## Explore Tdarr for AV1 Transcoding
- **Purpose:**
  - Transcoding for library compression to save space.
- **Plan:**
  - Explore AV1 transcoding.
- **Status:**
  - Not started.

## Explore Forking Radarr
- **Purpose:**
  - Bucket-list learning project to fork Radarr (C#/.NET) for custom features like revived Drone Factory.
- **Plan:**
  - Start with VS Code setup.
  - GitHub clone.
  - Contribute open-source.
- **Status:**
  - Not started.
  - Post-setup learning project.

## Self-Host Monero Node
- **Purpose:**
  - Run a full Monero node for local wallet syncing (e.g., Cake Wallet) and network contribution, emphasizing privacy against suppression.
- **Plan:**
  - Monitor resources/bandwidth ongoing.
  - Resync to full node to support monero project.
  - Add --restricted-rpc and SSL for remote sync.
- **Status:**
  - Not started.

## IPv6 Exploration
- **Purpose:**
  - Learn/setup IPv6 for potential speed gains, NAT simplification; cautious due to past hack concern.
- **Plan:**
  - Research official docs, test in isolated setup, monitor security.
- **Status:**
  - Not started.

## Ethernet Cable Testing
- **Purpose:**
  - Test spare cables/house run (50-70m) for 2.5G capability using crimp tool, keepLiNK spare port, CHOCKSMAINPC NIC, Proxmox ports.
- **Plan:**
  - Crimp/test short cable first, then long run; consider ISP 2G upgrade if viable (budget/dad concerns).
- **Status:**
  - Not started.

## Additional Software Exploration
- **Purpose:**
  - Setup/eval open-source tools for homelab.
- **Plan:**
  - Suricata (IDS/IPS); Crontab Guru/Cronitor (job monitoring); Prometheus/Grafana/InfluxDB/Telegraf/Netdata (monitoring); Duplicati (backups); Scanopy (https://github.com/scanopy/scanopy for network visualization and auto-discovery). dockage/portainer (management) 
- **Status:**
  - Not started.

## Tailscale Advanced
- **Purpose:**
  - Advanced Tailscale usage.
- **Plan:**
  - Explore exit nodes/filesharing post-stability.
- **Status:**
  - Pending exploration.

## Unified Backups
- **Purpose:**
  - Centralize all backups to NAS /backups folder, with secondary Syncthing copy.
- **Plan:**
  - Script/automate for all services (e.g., Jellyfin, HA, etc.).
- **Status:**
  - In progress.

## Advanced Monitoring Dashboard on Raspberry Pi
- **Purpose:**
  - Build advanced monitoring dashboard with Prometheus/Grafana/InfluxDB/Telegraf/Netdata, cycle pages on timer/metrics (e.g., Jellyfin watch triggers Homarr focus, spikes rotate to CPU/net views); organize growing Docker services and centralize notifications/monitoring for easier management and learning.
- **Plan:**
  - Use Pi for dedicated TV display (independent of PC); integrate with existing apps for overview (e.g., stalled alerts, drive risks); keep PC for Wallpaper Engine when wanted.
- **Status:**
  - In progress.

## Zabbix Monitoring Integration
- **Purpose:**
  - Deploy Zabbix for comprehensive homelab monitoring (servers, networks, containers) with dashboards, alerts, and low-resource options for budget setup.
- **Plan:**
  - Install server on Beelink Docker or Pi; agents on hosts (e.g., Proxmox, TrueNAS); configure browser GUI for metrics like CPU/net/drives; test scalability for 30+ containers.
- **Status:**
  - Not started.
