Overlay: Tailscale on key devices for remote access.

**Key Changes (Post-Power-Outage Migration - Jan 2026):**
- Eliminated double NAT on downstairs network.
- OPNsense LAN now directly routes 192.168.0.0/24 (vtnet1).
- Tenda MX12 demoted to pure Access Point mode (WiFi only, no routing/DHCP/NAT).
- Port forwards simplified: direct from OPNsense WAN to Beelink 192.168.0.9.
- DHCP centralized on OPNsense LAN interface (DNS pushed 192.168.0.1 for Unbound blocklists).
- All static/reserved IPs preserved.

Overlay Networks:
- Tailscale (Mesh VPN for Remote Access - On Beelink, CHOCKSMAINPC, Phone, Proxmox WAN PC/OPNsense)
  - Tailnet IPs: CHOCKSMAINPC (100.108.206.83), Beelink (100.75.79.68), Phone (100.64.40.62), Proxmox (100.112.76.14), truenas-scale (100.75.31.105)

Cloud Testing Server:
- GCP VM (IP: 35.189.61.183, Region: australia-southeast1, Machine Type: e2-medium)
  - Purpose: Bufferbloat testing with Flent RRUL/RRUL_BE (netserver on port 12865, iperf UDP listener)
  - Crontab: @reboot /usr/bin/netserver -4 -L 0.0.0.0 -p 12865 -D (starts on boot)
- Oracle Cloud VM (IP: 152.67.127.81, Region: Sydney, Shape: VM.Standard.E2.1.Micro, OS: Ubuntu)
  - Purpose: Secondary bufferbloat testing endpoint (netserver on port 12865); limited to ~50 Mbps symmetric internet bandwidth, sufficient for basic/low-speed validation or other tests but not full ~900/90 Mbps ISP testing.
  - Setup: Internet Gateway (vcn-20260107-1616), route table rule for 0.0.0.0/0 to IGW, security list egress all protocols to 0.0.0.0/0 and ingress TCP 12865 + ephemerals 1024-65535; netperf installed via apt, systemd service for boot, iptables rules for host firewall (allows from homelab IP 180.150.66.156).

**Key Explanations:**
- **Entry Point:** ISP NBN connects directly to OPNsense WAN (ix0 on the Proxmox-hosted VM), which handles firewall, routing, and QoS (FQ_CoDel configured for low jitter/bufferbloat).
- **Downstairs Network (Main LAN):** OPNsense LAN (ix1) provides WAN to Tenda MX12, which hosts the primary 192.168.0.x subnet. The keepLiNK switch acts as the core, connecting Beelink (server for media/Docker services), TrueNAS (NAS storage), and other devices. TP-Link PoE switch is daisy-chained to keepLiNK and powering 2 SMLight devices (one in Zigbee mode, one as Bluetooth mesh hub).
- **Upstairs Network:** OPNsense OPT1 (ix2) provides WAN to NF18Mesh (in double NAT mode with its own 192.168.30.x LAN). This isolates upstairs devices, including Proxmox management access (via DHCP on vmbr0/nic3), dad's PC, the external-tester Alpine CT on Proxmox for connectivity testing, Google TV, and parents' phones.
- **Proxmox WAN PC:** Hosts OPNsense VM with PCI passthrough for NICs (ix0/ix1/ix2). Management is via upstairs NF18 LAN (192.168.30.14), with Tailscale for remote stability.
- **Security/Access:** Port forwards on OPNsense (80/443 to Tenda 192.168.1.10) and Tenda (80/443 to Beelink 192.168.0.9 for Caddy). UFW on Beelink allows specific ports. Tailscale overlays for secure remote access.
- **Media/Storage Flow:** Jellyfin/*arr apps on Beelink pull from TrueNAS SMB shares (/mnt/media). Downloads cache on Beelink SSD, then move to NAS.
- **Home Assistant:** VM on TrueNAS (IP: 192.168.0.2 via downstairs LAN), connected to SLZB-06M Zigbee (192.168.0.12).
- **Ethernet Run Note:** The connection between OPNsense OPT1 (ix2) and Tenda MX12 is approximately 100m with two plugs. This run needs testing for 2.5G capability to assess 2G internet upgrade viability. Due to shortage of 2.5G ports upstairs, consider migrating Proxmox management from ix3/nic3 to the onboard 1G Ethernet port (Intel 82579V) to free ix3 for direct connection to CHOCKSMAINPC's 2.5G onboard NIC for testing.
- **Bufferbloat Testing:** Conducted using Flent RRUL/RRUL_BE with GCP VM netserver; no bloat observed (flat 5-6.5ms pings under 900/90Mbps load, peaks <10ms even in evening peak hours). FQ_CoDel pipes tuned to 950Mbps down/95Mbps up for A+ performance.
